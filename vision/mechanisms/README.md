### Instructions

The notebook `mechanisms.ipynb` contains the commands required to reproduce the warmup mechanisms for FCNs. 

SGD setting is default for quick reproducibility.

For full-batch experiments, set --num_examples 5000 and --batch_size 5000. 

For ResNet mechanisms, run the resnet scripts in the exact same fashion.
